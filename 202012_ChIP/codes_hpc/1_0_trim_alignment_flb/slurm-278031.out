AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> SRR955614_1.fastq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	4	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.00
Nextera	4	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count Illumina: 4, count Nextera: 4)
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 4). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 4)
