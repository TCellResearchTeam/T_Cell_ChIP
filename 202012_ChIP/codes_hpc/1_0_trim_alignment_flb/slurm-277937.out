Multicore support not enabled. Proceeding with single-core trimming.
Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)



AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> SRR955625_1.fastq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	2	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 2). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)
